# OTISpy
The Open source project to developed the new version OTIS model

## Introduction

OTISpy is a Python adaptation of the One-Dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage (OTIS) model originally developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1998. This project aims to bring the power and flexibility of the OTIS model to a wider audience by rewriting it in Python, a widely used programming language in scientific computing. By doing so, we make this valuable tool available for environmental research and education, enhancing its utility in modern research through improved compatibility and ease of use across various computing platforms.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. OTISpy is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
    
2. **Installation**:

3. **Running an example**
