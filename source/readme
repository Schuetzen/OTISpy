  OTIS: One-dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage
  -------------------------------------------------------
  Version: MOD40         Feb. 1998
  
  OTIS is a mathematical simulation model used to characterize the
  fate and transport of water-borne solutes in streams and rivers.
  The governing equation underlying the model is the advection-
  dispersion equation with additional terms to account for transient
  storage, lateral inflow, first-order decay and sorption. This
  equation and the associated equations describing transient
  storage and sorption are solved using a Crank-Nicolson finite
  difference solution.

  A modified version of OTIS, OTIS-P, couples the solution of the
  governing equations with a nonlinear regression package.  OTIS-P
  determines an 'optimal' set of parameter estimates that minimize the 
  squared differences between the simulated and observed concentrations.

  OTIS, OTIS-P and related materials are made available by the U.S.
  Geological Survey (USGS) to be used in the public interest and the
  advancement of science. You may, without any fee or cost, use, copy,
